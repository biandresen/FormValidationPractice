# Form Validation with JS

## About
Task from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation-with-javascript">The Odin Project. </a>
Practice project for using JS to do form validation.
Each input is checked for validation on "input".
On submit-button click all inputs are checked if valid or not. 
Everything has to be valid before form is submitted.
